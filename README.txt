This is my simulation. The main file is Cyclotron.java
My RK4 method is not working, its actually behaving like RK2, i could not see where i went wrong. 
I found pi/4 to be an optimal phase angle for this simulation. Such that the proton accelerates but also has self correcting orbits and does not spread much
At the moment 10 protons are set to be in the bunch with a uniform distribution.
50 turns are performed before the simulation ends.
Feel free to alter these variables.

UPDATE 04/12/17
This was my third year java project at university. It simulates the motions of protons in a partcile accelerator known as a cyclotron.
I used three different methods to update the position of the protons and compared them, RK4, Euler and Euler Cromer
When the simulation has run the csv files that are output are the data for the 3 different methods ready to be graphed.
The main method is located in Cyclotron.java
